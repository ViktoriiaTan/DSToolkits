** What is a Hash function? What are some of the use cases? **

A hash function is a special type of function in computing for implementing security. It takes input (which can be anything from a string of text to a file) and converts it into a fixed-size string of characters. This output, typically a sequence of numbers and letters (hash value/ hash code).  
Hash function is widely used:  
- Cryptocurrency (to secure transactions)  
- Password verification for authentication (websites hash and store passwords. During login, they compare the hash of the entered password with the stored hash for security)  
- Data and file integrity check (check the integrity of data or files. Checking the hash of an uploaded file against its original ensures that it hasnâ€™t been modified)  
- Digital signature (maintain the integrity of digital signatures. Data is hashed and encrypted for signing, and this process is reversed for verification)  

** What is a Python module, package and script? How do they differ from one another? **

* A module is a .py file containing Python code, including functions, classes, and variables. It is designed for reuse in other Python programs. Modules help in keeping the code structured and modular. They can be easily imported into other Python scripts. Python's community has a vast range of modules for various purposes, some being part of the standard library, while others can be installed via package managers like pip.  
* A package is a collection of related modules. It's essentially a directory structure with a special file __init__.py that allows Python to treat the directories as containing packages. This allows for logical organization of modules. For instance, the NumPy package includes modules for numerical operations, array handling, and mathematical functions, all designed to work together for numerical computing and data analysis.  
* A Python script is a file with executable Python code, typically saved with a .py extension. Scripts can be run directly by a Python interpreter and may include a mix of functions, classes, and standalone code. Scripts are often used for specific tasks or small programs and are the simplest form of Python code execution.  

** How would you explain a Docker container and volume to a child? **

** What is your preference concerning the use of Python virtualenv and Docker? When would you use one or the other? **

** What is the Docker build context? **

** How can you assess the quality of a python package on PyPI? **

We can assess the quality of a Python package on PyPI by first searching for and installing packages based on relevance, updates, and Python version compatibility; this is followed by reviewing the package's details on PyPI for legitimacy and project relevance. Additionally, we can explore the package's GitHub repository for community engagement indicators like stars, forks, and pull requests, and use Libraries.io for detailed statistics like dependencies, release history, and SourceRank score. And it's important to verify that the package's licence is suitable for our intended use, particularly for commercial or shared projects.
