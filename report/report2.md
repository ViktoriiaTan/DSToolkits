**What is a Hash function? What are some of the use cases?**

A hash function is a special type of function in computing for implementing security. It takes input (which can be anything from a string of text to a file) and converts it into a fixed-size string of characters. This output, typically a sequence of numbers and letters (hash value/ hash code).  
Hash function is widely used:  
- Cryptocurrency (to secure transactions)  
- Password verification for authentication (websites hash and store passwords. During login, they compare the hash of the entered password with the stored hash for security)  
- Data and file integrity check (check the integrity of data or files. Checking the hash of an uploaded file against its original ensures that it hasnâ€™t been modified)  
- Digital signature (maintain the integrity of digital signatures. Data is hashed and encrypted for signing, and this process is reversed for verification)  

**What is a Python module, package and script? How do they differ from one another?**

* A module is a .py file containing Python code, including functions, classes, and variables. It is designed for reuse in other Python programs. Modules help in keeping the code structured and modular. They can be easily imported into other Python scripts. Python's community has a vast range of modules for various purposes, some being part of the standard library, while others can be installed via package managers like pip.  
* A package is a collection of related modules. It's essentially a directory structure with a special file __init__.py that allows Python to treat the directories as containing packages. This allows for logical organization of modules. For instance, the NumPy package includes modules for numerical operations, array handling, and mathematical functions, all designed to work together for numerical computing and data analysis.  
* A Python script is a file with executable Python code, typically saved with a .py extension. Scripts can be run directly by a Python interpreter and may include a mix of functions, classes, and standalone code. Scripts are often used for specific tasks or small programs and are the simplest form of Python code execution.  

**How would you explain a Docker container and volume to a child?**
A Docker container is like a set of Lego. 
Each Lego piece, a building block represents a piece of the program: code, tools,  all files needed for running. 
Just as the Lego pieces themselves, Docker containers are also modular: if you need to, you could build any shape you can come up with: you have all the building blocks needed. Compatibility is also not an issue, all pieces can be connected and disconnected, reused when needed. You may also change (update) a block (container) without the compatibility being affected. There may be multiple pieces of the same block available too.
The blocks, just as the containers exist whether or not they are a part of an application or structure. The pieces are also portable, you can assemble them wherever you need them. 
A specific set of Lego, for example one that can build a starship or a police station, will come in a separate box. All the necessary pieces are found in the box to build the structure on the picture on the box. We do our best to not to mix up these boxes, but the Docker container will never have a problem with that: always keeps the necessary pieces for the set contained.

Now imagine that you have a magic Lego box with a secret compartment that keeps track of important information, records or items, tools and rare pieces, mini figures that get safely stored away in the secret compartment. That is similar to the Docker volume. 

You can build whatever you like in this magic box, but you have to remember one thing: once you close the box, all your creations will disappear, except for the items in the secret compartment.

**What is your preference concerning the use of Python virtualenv and Docker? When would you use one or the other?**
Virtualenv generally is the better choice for more lightweight or local projects, where a simpler environment capable of running a Python application is sufficient to separately run the necessary dependencies. Similarly to Docker containers, these virtual environments are capable of running confined, separate dependencies, however, this structure is created for running Python applications and they are not as robust as Docker containers.

Docker is a more complex system, capable of handling applications outside of Python too. It is best to use for more robust projects, where the program would be rolled out on multiple systems. It can handle multiple dependencies, including system-level ones, as well as different steps of the procedure, completely isolated. It is best to use for more demanding (non-local) deployment. 

**What is the Docker build context?**
The Docker build context is a set of files and directories that are sent to the Docker daemon when building a Docker image. When running a build, Docker CLI sends the contents of the specified directory (or the current directory by default) to the Docker daemon as the context. It's important to keep the build context minimal to speed up the build process.

**How can you assess the quality of a python package on PyPI?**

We can assess the quality of a Python package on PyPI by first searching for and installing packages based on relevance, updates, and Python version compatibility; this is followed by reviewing the package's details on PyPI for legitimacy and project relevance. Additionally, we can explore the package's GitHub repository for community engagement indicators like stars, forks, and pull requests, and use Libraries.io for detailed statistics like dependencies, release history, and SourceRank score. And it's important to verify that the package's licence is suitable for our intended use, particularly for commercial or shared projects.

## Task 6

Initially, we tried using the Tensorflow image from Docker Hub, but it was unable to handle the requirements file. 
Then we changed to the Python image. 
We chose the image that uses Python version 3.10, checked the requirements for compatibility and built the container.
We also added a Dockerignore file.
