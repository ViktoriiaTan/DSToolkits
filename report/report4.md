# Milestone 4 Report

## Task 1

**What is Experiment Management and why is it important?**

Experiment management is a systematic process that involves tracking and organising critical experiment metadata.  
This includes:
- Keeping track of different versions of the code used in various experiments;
- Documenting the versions of datasets utilised in training and evaluation;
- Recording the hyperparameter settings for each experiment;
- Documenting the computational environment, including software and hardware configuration;
- Logging key metrics that measure the performance of models.  
The main purpose of experiment management is to organise this information set in a meaningful way, to facilitate access, analysis and collaboration across the organisation. It ensures that experiments are reproducible, scalable and easily understandable by different team members, thereby fostering a collaborative and productive research environment.

**What is a Metric in ML?**

In Machine Learning, a Metric is a quantifiable measure used to evaluate and assess the performance of a ML model. They're a key element of every machine learning pipeline, allowing developers to fine-tune their algorithms and drive improvements.  
Metrics provide a way to objectively measure the effectiveness of a model in making predictions or classifications and they vary depending on the specific task (classification/ regression) that the model is designed for.

**What is Precision and Recall? Why is there often a Trade-off between them? - What is AUROC Metric?**

**What is a Confusion Matrix?**
